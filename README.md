# Hospital Power System Analysis & Automation â€“ Internship at Nepal Manipal Teaching Hospital

This repository showcases the first phase of my Electrical Engineering Internship at **Manipal Education and Medical Group â€“ Nepal Manipal Teaching Hospital**, Pokhara. Under the expert guidance of **Er. Laxman Acharya**, Iâ€™ve been immersed in the hands-on analysis, monitoring, and automation of critical hospital power systems.

Data analysis involving different domains,  PLC logics ,Dataset used to train model and Report produced are included in this repository.

 **Internship Start Date**: April 20, 2025  
 **Supervisor**: Er. Laxman Acharya  
 **Location**: Nepal Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara

##  Project Objectives

- Understand and analyze the hospitalâ€™s power infrastructure
- Ensure reliable power supply through automation and priority-based load management
- Apply PLC and SCADA technologies for real-time monitoring and control
- Perform data-driven analysis to forecast demand and optimize energy use

##  Key Tasks & Contributions â€“ Phase 1

1. **Power System Architecture**
   - Studied the layout of both grid-connected and generator-based backup power
   - Mapped energy flow and control points

2. **Bus Coupling & ATS**
   - Analyzed Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) for seamless transition
   - Observed real-time switching during outages and recovery

3. **Dual Generator PLC Logic**
   - Developed PLC logic for non-synchronized generators
   - Load-based start/stop and priority switching for critical load supply

4. **SCADA Integration**
   - Evaluated SCADA system for monitoring and control
   - Integrated generator operations with automated load management

5. **Priority Load Classification**
   - Classified loads into:
     - **Tier 1**: Most Essential
     - **Tier 2**: Essential
     - **Tier 3**: Non-Essential

6. **Energy Data Analysis**
   - Collected kWh readings from utility meters
   - Used Python (`pandas`, `numpy`) for:
     - Peak load analysis
     - Short-term demand forecasting

7. **Control Panel Review**
   - Analyzed switchgear systems:
     - VCBs, ACBs, MCCBs
     - Static & electromagnetic relays
     - Induction disc relays
   - Reviewed bus bar connections and safety mechanisms

8. **Electrical Drawings**
   - Created:
     - Sub-circuit layouts of control room
     - Single Line Diagrams (SLDs) of power system
