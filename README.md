## 📊 What This Repository Contains

### ✅ **Python-Based Energy Data Analysis**
- 📈 **Hourly Demand Curve Analysis**  
  Visualizing how hospital load changes hour-by-hour to understand typical daily profiles.

- 📊 **Load Pattern Clustering (K-Means)**  
  Unsupervised clustering to identify different load behavior patterns across days.

- ⚠️ **Energy Consumption Anomaly Detection**  
  Detecting unusual spikes/dips in usage using statistical thresholds and visual plots.

- ☀️ **Solar vs Non-Solar Hour Analysis**  
  Differentiating between solar and non-solar powered periods to analyze load dependency on sunlight.

- 🕒 **Peak Demand Profiling**  
  Identifying when the hospital consumes the most power, and how it varies by day/week.
